# "Model is trained on two-channel images, where the first channel is the channel to segment, 
# and the second channel is an optional nuclear channel."
# Options for each:
#   a. 0=grayscale, 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue
#   b. 0=None (will set to zero), 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue
# e.g. channels = [0,0] if you want to segment cells in grayscale
channels: [0,0]

# which channel to consider
channel: 'egfr'

# alt channel which will be summed
alt_channel: 'ereg'

# whether to sum channels (currently only channel 0 and 1)
sum_chan: True

# options:
# - list files
#   e.g. - Fov7_DC
#        - Fov8_DC
# - all 
#   i.e. does all the files
# - metadata
#   i.e. does the test files found in metadata
