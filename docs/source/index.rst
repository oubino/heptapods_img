locpix
======

**locpix** is a Python library for analysing point cloud data from SMLM.
This includes the following functionality:

#. Converting .csv files representing SMLM data (point cloud) into histograms
#. Manually annotating these histograms to extract relevant localisations
#. Utilising Classic method, Cellpose and Ilastik to segment the histograms to extract relevant localisations
#. Performance metrics calculation based on the localisations (not the histograms!)
