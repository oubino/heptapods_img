# load in relevant files (i.e. omit the necessary ones)

# load in prob npy file

# load in annotated df

# merge annotated df with prob npy file i.e. each localisation has prob

# use precision recall function in sklearn

# find maximal recall

# then threshold files for classic ilastik and cellpose based on these to get output semantic seg
