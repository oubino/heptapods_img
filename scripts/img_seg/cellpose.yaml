# "Model is trained on two-channel images, where the first channel is the channel to segment, 
# and the second channel is an optional nuclear channel."
# Options for each:
#   a. 0=grayscale, 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue
#   b. 0=None (will set to zero), 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue
# e.g. channels = [0,0] if you want to segment cells in grayscale
channels: [0,0]
# if False then it will attempt to load in markers already calculated to use for watershed, 
# if no markers are found then it will exit
# If True then user can pick the markers, this should always be set true to get markers first time
# in subsequent runs may want to retain same markers therefore set to False
